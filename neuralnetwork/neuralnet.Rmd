# neuralnet

`party` is a package coming from [December 2009 R Journal issue](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2010/RJ-2010-006/index.html). It introduces a package for neural networks in R. Last update comes from 2nd February 2019.

```{r, message=FALSE, output.lines=12}
library(neuralnet)

nn <- neuralnet(
    case~age+parity+induced+spontaneous,
    data=infert, hidden=2, err.fct="ce",
    linear.output=FALSE)
nn
```
**MOSTLY REP**
It's impossible to get the same output, because the way of displaying this object is somewhat different.

```{r}
nn$result.matrix
```
**MOSTLY REP**
Results may be randomly generated. What is more, rounding and displaying is different.

```{r}
out <- cbind(nn$covariate, nn$net.result[[1]])
dimnames(out) <- list(NULL, c("age","parity","induced", "spontaneous","nn-output"))
head(out)
```
**MOSTLY REP**
Results may be randomly generated. What is more, rounding and displaying is different.

```{r, output.lines=12}
nn.bp <- neuralnet(
    case~age+parity+induced+spontaneous,
    data=infert, hidden=2, err.fct="ce",
    linear.output=FALSE,
    algorithm="backprop",
    learningrate=0.01)
nn.bp
```
**MOSTLY REP**
It's impossible to get the same output, because the way of displaying this object is somewhat different.

```{r}
head(nn$generalized.weights[[1]])
```
**MOSTLY REP**
Results may be randomly generated, so there may be differences.

```{r, fig.keep='all'}
plot(nn)
```

**MOSTLY REP**
Results may be randomly generated, which can result in differences. Results can't be displayed by Markdown, but in basic R it works just fine.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
gwplot(nn,selected.covariate="age",
         min=-2.5, max=5)
gwplot(nn,selected.covariate="parity",
         min=-2.5, max=5)
gwplot(nn,selected.covariate="induced",
         min=-2.5, max=5)
gwplot(nn,selected.covariate="spontaneous",
         min=-2.5, max=5)
```
**MOSTLY REP**
Results almost look the same, altough some values can be seen to be significantly different.

```{r}
new.output <- compute(nn,
                      covariate=matrix(c(22,1,0,0,
                                         22,1,1,0,
                                         22,1,0,1,
                                         22,1,1,1),
                                       byrow=TRUE, ncol=4))
new.output$net.result
```
**MOSTLY REP**
Results may be randomly generated, so there may be differences.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ci <- confidence.interval(nn.new, alpha=0.05)
ci$lower.ci
```
**NO REP**
Authors gave us code to use on described `nn.new`, but didn't do the same with how to create this object, so this chunk is not reproducible.
